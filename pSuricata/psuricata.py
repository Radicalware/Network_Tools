	Suricata Parser

	usage: '''+green+'''
	$> psuricata.py -r pcap_file_name.pcap Exploit "-> 192.168.204.137"'''+white+'''

	Use the command above if you don't have logs stored for that pcap already
	The command will search for if either "Exploit" or "-> 192.168.204.137" pops
	'''+green+'''
	$> psuricata.py -u -g Network URI -a -v 18:19:24.107376'''+white+'''

	This command does not read a pcap file so it will used the one stored
	It uses boolean and '-a' so both 'Network' and 'URI' must be found
	also, there is a '-v' which means that the timestamp 18:19:24.107376
	will be omitted. The '-g' was needed because we had a '-v' in use.

	arguments:
	-r <pcap file>   = use this to update or parse your suricata pcap data
	-a               = Grep uses results from bool 'and' instead of default bool 'or'
	-g               = Greps the trailing array args until the next '-v'
	-v               = vGreps the trailing array args until the next '-g'
	-u               = Searches only for querys that have a url (HTTP traffic)

	That command will show the results that include the two arguments
	in the suricata output as an and statment.

	Be sure to make sure your interface matches and the http is enabled
	/etc/suricata/suricata.yaml
